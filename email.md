# Setting up email service for a client

If requested by a client, we can setup an email for them as `<clientname>.penguin.tools`. This domain will be used to send transactional emails from our system.

This is great to simplify the process when you need to send e.g. forgot password emails. If you have a non-tech client, it can be confusing for them to setup and maintain an account.

In no situation this setup can be handed out to the client. It is supposed to always stay a service that is only used for internally required functionality.
