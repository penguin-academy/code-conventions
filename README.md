# Pengu's Code Conventions

This guid explains the coding conventions we introduce in Penguin Lab projects.
Currently it is under heavy development and might change quickly.

This document partcularly addresses design decisions when working with the NON-Framework. Projects in different stacks may vary but if possible should be made close to these guides. 

### Resource Naming

1. Models
  ```
  import Shop from './models/Shop'
  ```
2. Page Components
  ```
  import ShopPage from './components/ShopPage'
  ```
